\homework{Fall 2018}{$3$}{}{}
\begin{footnotesize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feel free to talk to other students in the class when doing the homework. You should, however, write down your solution yourself. You also must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated and cite any other sources you use including
		Internet sites.
		\item You will write your solution in LaTeX and submit the pdf file through Gradescope. You also need to submit the zipped LaTeX files to CCLE.
		We will grade your homework based on the final  version of the pdf file submitted to Gradescope. We will not grade the zipped Latex files on CCLE. However, failure to submitting your LaTax files to CCLE will incur 2 points penalty out of 100 points.	
				\item The homework (both pdf and zipped Latex source files) is due at 3:59 PM before the class.
